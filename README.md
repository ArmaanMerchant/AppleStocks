This is the code to an algorithm that predicts Apple stocks.

Basically, I've collected Apple's stock data for the last 30 days and compressed it into a csv file (thanks Yahoo Finance).

Then I was able to create a graph to show me the trends using matplotlib. 

Finally, the AI can predict tomorrow's price to tell me whether it may be high or low.

Then, it's up to you, to invest or sell your Apple stock.

This was a blast making, if you have any questions please feel free to DM me on Linkedin!
